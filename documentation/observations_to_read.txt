Some thinks while I`m programming this application ( =

- My english is improving everyday, all write english was writed without translator, ok?
- This project no have folders how public, assets, view and another folder because is just back-end
- I will make do i18n in last
- This back-end api is clusterized, It replique if is needed and have a loadbalancer, need Redis
- I Could use GraphQL for Mongo
- Ah! I choosen Mongo ok? I not will use ORM than is used main in relational SGBD
- I can use transactions on querys... 
- If I have alot of time after minimum viable product, I will use Websocket to be real time
- I will do the uploads in publics/uploads path, in this webserver but I prefer in real application use external server to only media and upload
and use a server to front, a to back-end clusterized and a server to medias and uploads
- I will make softdelete because all information is important
- I will be a limit per hour of upload and publications, to evit DDOS
- Its used tokens for login, this allow logout on only machine or remove all tokens, making logout on all machine and check machine's history by token
- In some code you can think that there is more variable thar is need... I create a variable for simplify code to another people... When work in team, I code for me and to team
- Ah! I forget of talk... I USE SNACK_CASE IN VARIABLES ON THIS PROJECT, CAMMEL CASE ON FUNCTIONS AND METHODS... but is only my preference for Node, in PHP I use CammelCase to all in Default
- I think about why no used ORM in this project... find(), findOne(), one(), all() is great hahahah
- I have a custom: to for(), if() etc... my keys open a close in line ex: 
	if(){

	} else {

	}

	for( var i in arr ){
		
	}
but to methods and functions my keys close in next line... ex:
	function helloWork()
	{
		
	}

	Class heyHowLetsGo()
	{

	}
- This application will list junt categorys that is linked in one post... If not stay in one post, no list
- I can put "app" valiable when calling Service and not in all methods... is better...
- I think that... if create medias collection and more to one with post collection is better? or Ids in post collections how categorys?... well it`s no
relational SGBD, I will centralize all in Post but in NO-RELATIONAL how mysql or postgre for exemple, another table is better...
